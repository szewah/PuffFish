    <p>Communications is a science that draws on political studies, anthropology, sociology and psychology. 
    At best it provides clarity, becoming the "connective tissue" that binds the organization together, and 
    minimizes discrepencies in an organization's reputation.

    The effects may be non-inmediate, are indirect and different from person to person.
    Over the long term however, commmunication shapes thinking.

  <div class="section" id="approach">

    <p> Clients come to me with a specific or broad idea or a challenge related to communications inside an organization. Through conversations, 
    we outline an idea to test, something which gets results easily and quickly, and 
    plays to the clients strengths and resources. This approach is inspired by rapid prototyping, 
    a method used to accelerate the innovation process in design and manufacturing.
    <br>
    <br>
    From insights, and along with the clients intuition and experiences, we continue iterating, and build out the product and processes with the long term in mind. 
    This can be a podcast, employee influencer or thought leadership.
    I can provide strategic and content support, but my end goal is to help the client do it for themselves.
